    abstract     = {Abstract Groynes are widespread in the Middle Elbe River. They are important for navigation during low water. Due to the significant decrease of the flow velocity in comparison to the main stream, sedimentation of fine organic matter in the groyne fields (the area between two groynes) is high. The amount and location of sedimentation depend on hydraulic processes. The present paper presents the results of the actual (recent) sedimentation, and of the matter deposited in a typical groyne field in the Middle Elbe at Havelberg (German navigation km 420.9/river length 785.4). Furthermore, the development of water quality and suspended matter is described by the interpretation of data from an adjacent official water quality measuring point. From an ecological point of view, the high loads of nutrients and pollutants of the fine-grained sediment (mud) are of special interest. A close correlation was observed between the nutrient and pollutant load with the fine-grain size percentage and the content of particulate organic matter (POM). Groyne fields act as temporary sediment deposits, and are a latent danger to the ecosystem river Elbe. During construction work carried out at the river and extreme floods the mud could be remobilized, leading to a decrease in the water quality of the Elbe. Therefore, it is desirable that the organic mud should be removed from the river and deposited in a controlled landfill.}

Although flow hydrodynamics in side-cavity zones have been well studied, the impact of vegetation on recirculating flow is rarely considered. This study adopts large eddy simulation (LES) to examine the flow field in a rectangular embayment zone with different population densities of vegetation. The numerical model is validated by mean streamwise velocity data collected near mid-depth in the physical experiment. Vegetation rearranges the circulation structure in the DWZ and weakens the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. This negative effect increases with increasing population density. With the development of the shedding vortex induced in the front edge of the channel–embayment interface, the large-scale coherent structure forms in the mixing layer and is hardly affected by the variation of population density. As the population density increases, the mean retention time first decreases and then increases as a result of the combined action of three factors, namely, the large-scale coherent structure, the plant-induced Karman vortex street, and the blocking effect of dense vegetation.},

The obstacles are modelled as rectangular blocks and are located at one channel wall, perpendicular to the main stream direction. Two aspect ratios of the resulting dead zones are analysed. The flow structure is experimentally characterised by particle image velocimetry measurements in a laboratory flume and simulated using three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations. Good agreement between experimental measurements and numerical results is obtained. The results show that the effect of the obstacles in the main channel is observed up to one obstacle length in the spanwise direction. The spacing between obstacles does not seem to have a large influence in the outer flow. The mean flow within the dead zone is characterised by a large recirculation region and several additional vortex systems. They are discussed in the paper, as well as the mean and root-mean-square wall shear-stresses. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

    abstract     = {Many wetlands around the world are characterized by shallow water, dense vegetation in the littoral zones, no significant riverine inflow and minimal circulation. Recent research on the hydrodynamics of such wetlands has identified convective circulation as being important for flushing of the littoral zones. To quantify this process, a parameterization of the convective discharge per unit width, which had been previously developed for nonvegetated systems, was extended to include a drag coefficient dependent on Reynolds number and vegetation density. The drag coefficient also included the effect of anisotropic permeability of the vegetation. The effects of relatively dense emergent vegetation (~17\% by volume) on convective flushing of shallow wetlands with low-Reynolds number (~100) flow was then investigated using experiments in a laboratory convection tank (0.5 by 2 by 0.1 m) and in a wetland mesocosm (5 by 15 by 1 m). Bottom convective currents of ~1-10 mm s21 were measured in both the laboratory and the mesocosm. These currents resulted in the shallow, vegetated regions of the mesocosm being flushed in 4 h. The discharge per unit width (m2 s-1) predicted by the developed parameterization compared favorably (R2 = 0.7) with the discharge per unit width measured in both the laboratory and the mesocosm. The short timescales of convective flushing, even in the presence of reasonably dense vegetation, indicate the likely significance of this mechanism in sheltered wetlands.}

    abstract     = {This research is aimed at finding efficient alternative designs, in the physical, economical, and ecological sense, for the standard groynes as they are found in the large rivers of Europe. In order to test the effects of various groyne shapes on the flow in a groyne field, experiments were performed in a physical model of a schematized river reach, geometrically scaled 1:40. Four different types of schematized groynes were tested, all arranged in an array of five identical groyne fields, i.e., standard reference groynes, groynes with a head having a gentle slope and extending into the main channel, permeable groynes consisting of pile rows, and hybrid groynes consisting of a lowered impermeable groyne with a pile row on top. Flow velocities were measured using particle tracking velocimetry. The design of the experiment was such that the cross-sectional area blocked by the groyne was the same in all cases. Depending on the groyne head shape and the extent of submergence variations in the intensity of vortex shedding and recirculation in the groyne field were observed. The experimental data are used to understand the physical processes like vortex formation and detachment near the groyne head. It is demonstrated that the turbulence properties near and downstream of the groyne can be manipulated by changing the permeability and slope of the groyne head. It is also observed that for submerged conditions the flow becomes complex and locally dominated by three-dimensional effects, which will make it difficult to predict by applying depth average numerical models or by three-dimensional models with a coarse resolution in the vertical direction.}

Detailed measurements were carried out in groyne fields with aspect ratios (length of groynes/distance between successive groynes) of 0.75 and 0.35 for emerged and submerged conditions and provided detailed spatial patterns of mean and turbulent fluxes of momentum. The results indicate that in mixing interfaces the vertical fluxes of turbulent momentum are dominant near the riverbed whereas horizontal fluxes dominate near the surface. Strong three-dimensional effects are reported for submerged groynes when a wake is formed at the leeward side. Groyne sequences increase flow resistance mainly by flow constriction that in turn generates an increase in velocity and bed shear stress in the main channel, rather than by production of excessive turbulence near the groynes.}

    abstract     = {The dispersive mass transport in rivers has been investigated to improve the predictability of transport scenarios in case of accidental pollutant spills. In particular, the influence of dead-water zones, as they are given by groin fields, on the transport characteristics in the main stream has been analyzed. A literature review of detailed map material from the rivers Rhine, Waal and Elbe has been performed, in order to plan representative laboratory experiments. Typical aspect ratios of the groin fields as well as typical inclination angles have been summarized. Based on these results, experiments have been performed in a laboratory flume equipped with schematized groins. Within theses experiments the aspect ratio, the inclination angles as well as the groin field volume has been varied. Due to the fact that the flow is very shallow and, therefore, quasi two-dimensional, the flow velocities have been determined at the water surface, using a Surface Particle-Image-Velocimetry-System that has been developed for that purpose. Additional measurements, using a two-dimensional Laser-Doppler-Velocimeter, have been performed for resolving the velocity distribution over the water depth. With the help of these measurements it was possible to determine the typical recirculating flows in the groin fields as well as the coherent, horizontal eddies in the mixing layer between dead-water zone and main stream, that are governing the mass exchange. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the surface PIV measurements made it possible to estimate also the mass exchange between groin field and main stream. With the help of Planar-Concentration-Analysis, which is a method for determining depth-averaged planar concentration fields, it could be shown that the mass exchange between groin field and main stream increases with increasing length of the groin field. For these measurements a tracer injection device has been developed, that consists of a movable multi-port injection-box and vacuum-pressure-unit, which is able to produce instantaneously, homogeneous and reproducible concentration fields. Finally a Lagrangian-Particle-Tracking-Method was developed to transfer the results, obtained locally at single groin fields, into the overall transport characteristics in the far-field of pollutant spill scenario for a river system consisting of a series of groin fields. Through the implementation of a transient-adhesion-boundary, it was possible to parameterize the influence of groin fields on the longitudinal dispersion, the transport velocity and the skewness of the concentration distribution in the case of a pollutant spill.},

    abstract     = {Peak power production in hydroelectric storage power plants results in frequent and intense flow variations in the rivers downstream of the plants. Fish populations can be negatively impacted when subjected to these so-called hydropeaking phenomena. In researching mitigation solutions, shelters in the riverbanks of channelized rivers have been identified as a means of protecting fish from excessive flow velocities. These shelters were studied systematically using juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) in an experimental configuration in which a straight channel was equipped with a lateral embayment. The purpose of the experiments was to generate hydrodynamic hydropeaking conditions in the channel that are undesirable for juvenile trout, thereby causing them to enter the shelter. The flow velocity distribution in the intersection plane between the main channel and the lateral shelter was found to be a significant parameter for attracting fish to the shelter. The utilization rate of trout in the shelter was used as a performance indicator. Using a basic rectangular shelter configuration without forced water exchange between the shelter and the channel, the utilization rate was only 35 {\%}. This rate was more than doubled by introducing a deviation groyne to force water exchange between the channel and the shelter. The position and orientation angle of this groyne were systematically varied to maximize the utilization rate. Maximum utilization rates approaching 90 {\%} were obtained for an optimum configuration in which an island-type groyne was placed in the shelter. The results of the systematic channel tests showed the potential of the shelter to attract fish. Such a shelter could be used in channelized rivers both for morphological revitalization and to improve fish habitats. As a next step in this research, prototype shelters will be built on a natural river and monitored for 2–3 years under a hydropeaking flow regime.}

    abstract     = {The actively flowing waters of streams and rivers remain in close contact with surrounding off-channel and subsurface environments. These hydrologic linkages between relatively fast flowing channel waters, with more slowly flowing waters off-channel and in the subsurface, are collectively referred to as hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs). HEFs include surface exchange with a channel's marginal areas and subsurface flow through the streambed (hyporheic flow), as well as storm-driven bank storage and overbank flows onto floodplains. HEFs are important, not only for storing water and attenuating flood peaks, but also for their role in influencing water conservation, water quality improvement, and related outcomes for ecological values and services of aquatic ecosystems. Biogeochemical opportunities for chemical transformations are increased by HEFs as a result of the prolonged contact between flowing waters and geochemically and microbially active surfaces of sediments and vegetation. Chemical processing is intensified and water quality is often improved by removal of excess nutrients, metals, and organic contaminants from flowing waters. HEFs also are important regulators of organic matter decomposition, nutrient recycling, and stream metabolism that helps establish a balanced and resilient aquatic food web. The shallow and protected storage zones associated with HEFs support nursery and feeding areas for aquatic organisms that sustain aquatic biological diversity. Understanding of these varied roles for HEFs has been driven by the related disciplines of stream ecology, fluvial geomorphology, surface-water hydraulics, and groundwater hydrology. A current research emphasis is on the role that HEFs play in altered flow regimes, including restoration to achieve diverse goals, such as expanding aquatic habitats and managing dissolved and suspended river loads to reduce over-fertilization of coastal waters and offset wetland loss. New integrative concepts and models are emerging (eg, hydrologic connectivity) that emphasize HEF functions in river corridors over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.},

    abstract     = {Abstract River restoration works often include measures to promote morphological diversity and enhance habitat suitability. One of these measures is the creation of macro-roughness elements, such as lateral cavities and embayments, in the banks of channelized rivers. However, in flows that are heavily charged with fine sediments in suspension, such as glacier-fed streams and very low-gradient reaches of large catchment rivers, these lateral cavities may trap these sediments. Consequently, the morphological changes may be affected, and the functionality of the restoration interventions may be compromised. Herein, we analyse the influence of these macro-roughness elements on the transport of fine sediments in the main channel. Laboratory tests with uniform flow charged with sediments in a channel with banks equipped with large-scale rectangular roughness elements were carried out. The laboratory experiments covered a wide range of rectangular cavity geometrical configurations and shallowness ratios. The influence of key parameters such as flow shallowness, geometric ratios of the cavities and initial sediment concentration was tested. Surface particle image velocimetry, sediment samples and temporal turbidity records were collected during the experiments. The amount of sediments captured by the cavities, the temporal evolution of the concentration of sediments in suspension and the flow hydrodynamics are cross-analysed and discussed. It is shown that the trapping efficiency of the macro-roughness elements is a clear function of the channel geometry and the shallowness of the flow.

    abstract     = {Natural lateral cavities in open channels are important because their lower water velocities promote water quality and provide refugia for organisms. Little is known about the influence of natural cavity shapes and roughness on flow structure and exchange dynamics. We investigated the effects of cavity shape (semi-circular, backward conic, and forward conic) and bed roughness on the flow structure and mean residence time (MRT) of a lateral cavity in a flume. All cavity shapes have a flow field dominated by a one-gyre recirculation pattern, contrasting results of rectangular cavities at similar Reynolds number and aspect ratios. Transverse velocity energy spectra indicate the flow is dominated by large-scale quasi-2D coherent structures. Fundamental frequencies of mixing layer vortex shedding are fastest for forward conic cavities and slowest for backward conic cavities. Fluid enters cavities at shallower mixing layer depths, and fluid exits cavities at deeper mixing layer depths. MRTs are smaller for hydraulically smooth cases and forward conic cavities due to higher recirculation velocities. MRTs are larger for rough bed cases and backward conic cavities. Rough flow cases have a strong correlation to a predictive MRT relationship derived by Jackson et al. (Water Resour Res: 10.1002/wrcr.20272, 2013) (R2 = 0.77); however, this predictive model does not work well for smooth cavities. Two MRT relationships were derived for smooth lateral cavities and both have strong power-law correlations to normalized MRT. Understanding cavity shape and bed roughness effects will provide a guideline for designing lateral embayments in stream restoration projects.},

The patch diameter, D, and patch density, a (frontal area per volume), are varied. The flow structure is linked to a nondimensional flow blockage parameter, CDaD, which is the ratio of the patch diameter and a drag length scale (CDa)−1. CD is the cylinder drag coefficient. The velocity exiting the patch, Ue, is reduced relative to the upstream velocity, U∞, and Ue/U∞ decreases as flow blockage (CDaD) increases. A predictive model is developed for Ue/U∞. The wake behind the patch contains two peaks in turbulence intensity. The first peak occurs directly behind the patch and is related to turbulence production within the patch at the scale of individual cylinders. The second peak in turbulence intensity occurs at distance Lwdownstream from the patch and is related to the wake-scale vortices of the von Karman vortex street. The presence of the flowUe in the wake delays the formation of the von Karman vortex street until distance L1 ({\textless}Lw) behind the patch. Both L1 and Lw increase as Ue increases and thus as the flow blockage (CDaD) decreases. L1sets the distance behind the patch within which fine-particle deposition can occur.

    abstract     = {In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the ecological role of groyne fields as habitats for aquatic vegetation; however, knowledge on interactions between vegetation and recirculating flow is still lacking, especially vegetation effects on large-scale coherent structures in the mixing layer, which control the mass exchange between the side-cavity and the main channel. In this paper, the hydrodynamics of the mixing layer in straight open channels without sediments in the flow, with consecutive groyne fields, of different vegetation densities, is investigated both experimentally through particle image velocimetry and numerically through large eddy simulation. The results show that the presence of plants rearranges the circulation systems in the groyne field, namely, from double gyres to a single gyre. With an increase in the vegetation density, the exchange coefficient between the cavity and the main channel gradually decreases. Note that the exchange rate is calculated from a newly proposed exchange layer, which is located away from the groyne tip. Based on the analysis of the Kelvin-Helmholtz eddies along the shear layer, a phenomenological model is proposed for the evolution of coherent structures and the variations in flow hydrodynamics associated with these eddies. Compared to the non-vegetation case, the presence of vegetation could suppress the evolution of coherent eddies in the mixing layer, with a consequent effect on the flow hydrodynamics around the interface.},

    abstract     = {The flow hydrodynamics in a straight open channel containing a multiple-embayment groyne field on one of its sides is investigated numerically using large eddy simulation. The vertical groynes are fully emerged. The mean flow depth in the groyne region is about half that of the main channel and the length and width of the embayments are much larger than the mean depth in the embayment region. The model is validated using mean velocity and turbulent fluctuations data collected at the free surface in a previous experimental study. It is found that despite the fact that the flow inside the main recirculation eddy in the embayments can be characterized as being quasi-two dimensional, the flow inside the mixing layer region between the embayments and the channel is strongly nonuniform over the depth. As this region controls the mass exchange processes between the groyne field and the main channel, a three-dimensional description of the flow in this area is essential. The large-scale eddies that populate the mixing layer can penetrate the embayment region over lateral distances of the order of the channel depth. These eddies advect with them channel fluid inside the. embayment. Eventually, the channel fluid is mixed with the embayment fluid by the small scales. The other main mixing mechanism is due to the injection of patches of high-vorticity mixing-layer fluid near the tip of the downstream groyne and their subsequent convection in the form of a wall-attached jet-like flow into the embayment, first parallel to the downstream groyne face and then to the sidewall. It is shown that on average, most of the fluid leaves the embayment region via the top layer of the embayment-channel interface (upstream half) and enters the embayment region at levels situated around the middepth (practically over the whole length of the embayment) of the interface surface. This explains why the mass exchange coefficients are overestimated when predicted using methods that employ floating particles as a tracer. The instantaneous bed shear stress inside the cavity is found to peak close to the downstream groyne face of each embayment and to show a high variability around the mean values due to the interaction of the mixing layer eddies with the tip of the groynes and the formation of the jet-like flow parallel to the droyne face.},

We analysed this effect on the occurrence of dragonfly larvae along middle and lower stretches of the Oder, where groynes were built over a distance of 306km, creating an area of uniform habitat. We demonstrated that the presence of groynes increased not only the abundance of dragonfly larvae, but also the species richness and diversity of these insects. Habitats were recreated for assemblages typical of a river with highly diverse habitat conditions, from typically riverine assemblages to those occurring in oxbow lakes, also endangered by regulations. The fauna along the stretches with groynes was richer and more valuable than that along the stretches without groynes, achieving values approaching those obtained from modelled unregulated rivers. This can be put down to greater habitat heterogeneity and groyne-reduced levels of waves produced by ships. The presence of groynes provides the key to the restoration or stabilisation of the populations of certain species and to renaturalisation processes.},

We found that groyne construction increased species richness, diversity, evenness, and altered the structure of functional groups into more diversified and sustainable ones compared to the control sites. The groyne field fauna is similar to that of natural lentic habitats, but its composition is largely governed by the presence of potential colonists in the nearby oxbows. We distinguished three of the river's caddisfly assemblages. The distribution of Trichoptera was governed inter alia by the plant cover and the amount of detritus, and consequently, the food resources. Oxygen, nitrates, phosphates and electrolytic conductivity were important as well. Groynes have had positive effects for caddisflies—not only those in the river itself, but also those in its valley. They can therefore be of significance in river restoration (although originally they served other purposes), especially with respect to the radically transformed ecosystems of large rivers.},

Lateral cavities are major storage zones in riverine environments for which the mass exchanges with the main stream strongly impact the characteristics of the habitat in these dead zones. An experimental work is presented here with a controlled main stream and a connected open-channel lateral cavity to assess the processes responsible for these exchanges and to quantify the exchange capacities. In a first step, the measurements of passive scalar transport allow us to identify the physical processes involved in the exchange of mass from the main stream and its spreading within the cavity. In a second step, the quantitative mass exchange coefficient, representative of the exchange capacity, is measured for 28 flow and cavity configurations. The sensibility analysis to the governing parameters proposed by the dimensional analysis then reveals that changing the geometric aspect ratio of the cavity does not affect the exchange coefficient while increasing the normalized water depth or decreasing the Reynolds number of the main stream tend to increase this coefficient. Indeed, these parameters modify both the growth rate of the mixing layer width at the interface and the amplitude of the alternating transverse velocity across the interface, thus affecting the exchange capacities from the main stream to the cavity.},

    abstract     = {This chapter addresses modeling concepts based on the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for laminar-turbulent transition prediction in general-purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. Available models are reviewed, with emphasis on their compatibility with modem CFD methods. Requirements for engineering transition models suitable for industrial CFD codes are specified. The main criterion is that nonlocal operations should be avoided. The U-Re?transition model was built on these requirements. The model solves two transport equations and can be applied to any arbitrary geometry. Current limitations of the model are that cross-flow instability is not included in the correlations and that the transition correlations are formulated non-Galilean invariant. Both limitations are currently investigated and can in principle be removed. An overview of test cases computed with the new model is given. The purpose of the overview is to highlight that the model can handle a wide variety of geometries and physically diverse problems. It is suggested that the central concept of combining transition correlations with locally formulated transport equations has a strong potential for including first-order transitional effects into today's industrial CFD simulations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Spur dikes are built across the flow to defend the stream erosion and facilitate the shifting of the river away from the bank. The spur dike weakens due to stream bed scouring and erosion, which is usually documented as the key reason of spur dike failure. Failure of spur dikes due to local scour has inspired many investigators to discover the cause of scouring phenomenon and to forecast the temporal and maximum scour depth near spur dikes. In this paper, a review of the scour around spur dikes with all possible aspects, like temporal and maximum scour depth, flow pattern, parameters affecting scour phenomenon has been discussed briefly.},

    abstract     = {Laboratory experiments are presented that model the exchange processes between a river and dead-water zones created by groin fields. The measurement methods include particle image velocimetry (PIV) at the water surface to capture the dynamics of the flow field as well as planar concentration analysis (PCA) to determine the depth integrated mass fluxes of dissolved tracer. Idealized groins with variable length-to-width ratios and inclination angles relative to the flow direction are investigated. Two-dimensional large coherent structures (2DLCS) are found in the mixing layer between the groin field and the river, and these flow structures control the majority of mixing with the main stream. The PIV data allow quantification of the turbulence intensity distribution in these structures throughout the groin field and mixing region. The PCA data provide measurements of the exchange rate between the groin field and the main stream. Both methods give comparable measures of the entrainment coefficient for the exchange flow. The entrainment coefficient is found to depend on the groin field hydraulic radius (a measure of the average size of 2DLCS in the mixing layer) and the water depth (a parameter controlling the stability of the shallow water flow). These data provide a link between the exchange parameter in groin field dead zones and the river properties that can be used to efficiently develop river alarm models to predict contaminant transport without requiring a large amount of field dye studies for calibration.

The growth of new vegetation occurred in regions where the flow velocity was reduced below a threshold value defined as a fraction of the channel-average velocity (U0). Two threshold values, or limiting velocity values (LV), were used: LV = 0.5 and 0.7. Two initial blockage factors (percentage vegetation coverage of the channel) were considered, 3{\%} and 0.3{\%}, chosen to represent cases with and without, respectively, hydrodynamic interaction between the initial patches. The simulation illustrated both positive feedbacks between flow and vegetation, which enhanced vegetation expansion, and negative feedbacks, which led to patch erosion and limited patch growth. The most rapid expansion of the vegetated area occurred during the initial simulation steps, when the flow blockage due to vegetation was small. A higher velocity threshold (higher LV) produced more rapid initial growth and a higher final coverage of vegetation. The patches evolved to one or a few elongated islands extending along the channel.},

The results showed that the presence of vegetation resulted in residence times closer to plug flow, indicating significant improvements in stormwater treatment capability. The new modelling approach reflects changes in residence time due to mixing within the vegetation, but it also suggests that it is more important to include vegetation within the model in the correct location than it is to accurately characterise it. Estimates of hydraulic efficiency suggest that fully vegetated stormwater ponds such as wetlands should function well as a treatment device, but more typical ponds with clear water need to be designed to be between 50{\%} and 100{\%} larger than their nominal residence times would suggest when designed against treatment criteria.},

It is expected that higher As may enhance the interaction between nutrients and biota and thus, increase nutrient uptake. However, results from the literature are controversial. We hypothesized that besides of the size of As, the intrinsic physical and biological characteristics of stream structures that generate As are also relevant for nutrient uptake. We performed 24 additions of phosphate, ammonium, and chloride in four reaches of a man-made channel where we introduced three types of naturally colonized substrata packs (mud, sand and cobbles) to modify As. We estimated ammonium and phosphate uptake coefficients in both the main channel and As using a solute transport model (OTIS-P) and compared the results among reaches with different substrata types. The introduction of substrata packs decreased water velocity and increased As similarly among treatments. Nutrient uptake coefficients in the main channel were similar among reaches with different type substrata packs; however, nutrient uptake coefficients measured in As differed among them as well as the ratio between ammonium and phosphorus uptake coefficients in As, which were 1.6 in reaches with mud packs and 0.02 in reaches with sand or cobble packs. Results obtained in this study suggest that the contribution of As in nutrient uptake not only depends on the size of As but on the type of materials used to increase As, and thus, have biogeochemical implications on restoration projects aimed to modify channel morphology.}

    abstract     = {The exchange of dissolved matter between a groyne field and a main stream influences the trans-port and distribution of a pollutant cloud in a river. In forecasting models, groyne fields are represented as dead zones with effective properties like exchange coefficients and exchanging volume. Despite its relevance for such practical applications, little research has been done on the exchange process between a groyne field and the main stream itself. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining this exchange process and validating the dead-zone prediction model, which treats the exchange process as a first order system. A schematized physical model of a river with groynes was built in a laboratory flume. The exchange process was visualized quantitatively with dye in adjacent groyne fields. In order to couple the exchange process to the velocity field, particle tracking velocimetry measurements were performed. Two different types of exchange were observed. First, exchange takes place via the mixing layer that is formed at the river-groyne-field interface. The large eddies formed in the mixing layer are the major cause of this exchange. Second, under certain conditions, even larger eddies are shed from the upstream groyne tip. Distortions in the flow field caused by such intermittent structures cause a much larger exchange than that by the mixing layer alone. The occurrence of large shed eddies depends on the presence of a sufficiently large, stationary, secondary gyre located at the upstream corner of the groyne field. The overall exchange of matter could be characterized as a first-order process, in accordance with the dead-zone-theory. The corresponding exchange coefficients agreed reasonably well with the results of earlier exper-iments and the effective coefficients as found in experiments in real river flows.},

The seven-equation method shows that the coupling error based on Hypothesis I is much smaller as compared with the numerical and modeling errors and therefore can be neglected. The authors recommend five-equation method based on Hypothesis II, which shows a monotonic convergence behavior of the predicted numerical benchmark (S C ), and provides realistic error estimates without the need of fixing the orders of accuracy for either numerical or modeling errors. Based on the results from seven-equation and five-equation methods, less expensive three and four-equation methods for practical LES applications were derived. It was found that the new three-equation method is robust as it can be applied to any convergence types and reasonably predict the error trends. It was also observed that the numerical and modeling errors usually have opposite signs, which suggests error cancellation play an essential role in LES. When Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based error estimation method is applied, it shows significant error in the prediction of S C on coarse meshes. However, it predicts reasonable S C when the grids resolve at least 80{\%} of the total turbulent kinetic energy.},

This work is focused on this latter purpose: promotion of hydraulic and morphologic diversity. In these scenarios, an increase in the flow discharge in the main channel may, however, re-mobilize the deposit of sediment inside these lateral embayments and cause a sudden increase of the sediment concentration and turbidity in the main channel. It is thus of interest to characterize the resistance and resilience of these sedimentary deposits when the main channel is subjected to high flow or flushing events. Laboratory tests were carried out for five different normalized geometries of the cavities installed in the banks of an open channel and for five hydrographs with different levels of unsteadiness. Water depth, sediment deposit mass, sediment concentration and area covered by the settled sediments were recorded throughout each experiment. Although sediment deposits established at equilibrium before the flushing events are different depending on the geometry of the cavities, generally, they are recovered after being flushed by the high flow events. It is shown that the resistance and resilience of the sediment deposits are strongly dependent on the flow field and the mass exchange between the main channel and the cavities. This mass exchange is governed by the geometry of the cavities and the magnitude of the hydrographs applied.},

These wetlands were formed when the navigational pool elevation increased through the construction of the locks and dams for river navigation and low-lying areas adjacent to the Ohio River were inundated. The primary purpose of this study was to document and provide plant species and community information among embayment habitats. Five embayments were quantitatively sampled for woody and herbaceous species during summer and fall, of 1990 and 1991. Tree and shrub/sapling communities were evaluated through the use of relative important values. Herbaceous and aquatic communities were defined through the use of relative importance values, cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and multi-response permutation procedure. A non-metric multi-dimensional scaling, an indirect ordination procedure, was also used to evaluate potential underlying environmental gradients. There were 257 species of vascular plants recorded from approximately 27 ha of embayment habitat. Embayment wetlands capture approximately 25 percent of the species that are common elements of the floodplain. More than half the number of species encountered across the sample area was restricted to one or two sites. This suggests that these wetlands have common elements at large broad scales with distinct elements at local scales. There were differences in herbaceous plant species, richness and diversity (HO and composition among embayment sites (P {\textless} 0.01). Analyses of 497 vegetation plots and quadrats revealed 17 plant communities. There were five forest communities of Acer saccharinum, four A. saccharinum and one Alnus serrulata shrub/sapling communities. The herbaceous and aquatic plant communities were characterized by eight communities that were common to the region and four communities that were considered unique. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and multi-response permutation procedures results (P {\textless} 0.01) show that plant species were distributed according to embayment location, age and size and to a lesser extent according to species composition (non-native species, Coefficient of Conservatism, species richness and H') and wetland indicator status probability values. Our study shows that embayment wetlands hold species rich habitats and that more surveys (qualitative and quantitative) are needed to address questions that relate to biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and hydrogeomorphologic characterization.}

Embayments differed in surface area and depth, varied in their connections to Lake Ontario and their watersheds, and drained watersheds representing a gradient of agricultural to forested land use. Results: We related various physicochemical factors, including total phosphorus load, embayment area, and submerged vegetation, to differences in fish species diversity and community relative abundance, biomass, and size structure both among and within embayments. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and centrarchids numerically dominated most embayment fish communities. Biomass was dominated by piscivorous fishes including brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), bowfin (Amia calva), and northern pike (Esox lucius). Phosphorus loading influenced relative biomass, but not species diversity or relative abundance. Fish relative abundance differed among embayments; within embayments, fish abundance at individual sampling stations increased significantly with submerged vegetative cover. Relative biomass differed among embayments and was positively related to total phophorus loading and embayment area. Fish community size structure, based on size spectra analysis, differed among embayments, with the frequency of smaller-bodied fishes positively related to percent vegetation. Conclusion: The importance of total phosphorus loading and vegetation in structuring fish communities has implications for anthropogenic impacts to embayment fish communities through activities such as farming and residential development, reduction of cultural eutrophication, and shoreline development and maintenance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Arend and Bain; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Although flow hydrodynamics in groyne fields is subject of intensive ongoing research, knowledge of vegetation effects on recirculating flow remains lacking. This paper reports the results of field experiments in a natural river comprising large-scale groyne models populated with rigid and flexible artificial vegetation. In the experimental runs population density, submergence ratios, and vegetation types were varied. The results show that vegetation rearranges twin-circulation flow into slow backwater flow. The magnitude of backwater flow is controlled by the bio-mechanical properties of vegetation. The hydrodynamics of the flow interface between the main river and groyne fields was only slightly altered by vegetation. Analytical models of flow at the interface and inside vegetated areas agree well with these experimental results.},

In shallow ({\textless}2 m), unvegetated regions significant resuspension of bottom sediments was evident when northerly winds exceeded 25 km h-1, increasing SPM concentrations up to 10-fold. High concentrations of SPM generated by resuspension dissipated rapidly (within 24 h) after winds became calm. Patterns of SPM along the embayment's depth gradient suggest that part of this resuspended material was transported offshore into deeper reaches of the estuary. In areas of the embayment colonized by seagrasses, wave energy was attenuated by the vegetation, suppressing resuspension and enhancing deposition. As a result, SPM concentrations were significantly lower inside seagrass beds than in adjacent unvegetated areas. During periods of high winds when wave induced resuspension occurred in unvegetated areas, SPM concentrations remained unchanged inside the bed at normal water levels. However, when water levels were elevated by spring tides or storm surges, plants were less effective at attenuating wave energy, and SPM concentrations increased inside the seagrass bed due to resuspension and advective processes. Calculations based on the results of this study indicate that sedimentation rates are substantially higher in seagrass communities than in unvegetated areas. {\textcopyright} 1984.}

    abstract     = {Open-ended side-cavity zones are often observed in natural rivers. They appear in embayment and aligned spur-dike fields. Many pollutant clouds and suspended sediments are conveyed and trapped in the cavities, and it is thus very important in environmental hydraulics and river management to accurately predict mass and momentum exchanges through mainstream/side-cavity interface. It is well known that small-scale shedding vortices are generated due to shear instability induced by velocity differences between high-speed mainstream and low-speed embayment flows. A large momentum in the main-channel causes large-scale horizontal gyre in the cavity zone. The coherent turbulence structure in the mainstream/embayment boundary and the horizontal large-scale gyre structure play a key role in the mass/momentum exchanges. In particular, previous studies have pointed out that a rectangular- shaped cavity zone with an aspect ratio of 3.0 produces two kinds of gyres and shows a more effective exchange property in comparison with a square-shaped cavity. However, much uncertainty remains regarding the detailed hydrodynamics accompanied by three-dimensional turbulence motions. Using large eddy simulation, which is also compared with particle image velocimetry measurements, we predict three-dimensional current properties and turbulence structure. Based on these results, a significant relation between instantaneous vertical flows and the spanwise momentum transfer is shown. Furthermore, a phenomenological flow model is proposed for the side-cavity zone in the open-channel field. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.},

    abstract     = {Surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) have functional significance in stream ecology and hydrology. Currently, tracer techniques couple STS and HTS effects on stream nutrient cycling; however, STS resides in localized areas of the surface stream and HTS resides in the hyporheic zone. These contrasting environments result in different storage and exchange mechanisms with the surface stream, which can yield contrasting results when comparing transient storage effects among morphologically diverse streams. We propose a fluid mechanics approach to quantitatively separate STS from HTS that involves classifying and studying different types of STS. As a starting point, a classification scheme is needed. This paper introduces a classification scheme that categorizes different STS in riverine systems based on their flow structure. Eight STS types are identified and some are subcategorized based on characteristic mean flow structure: (1) lateral cavities (emergent and submerged); (2) protruding in-channel flow obstructions (backward- and forward-facing step); (3) isolated in-channel flow obstructions (emergent and submerged); (4) cascades and riffles; (5) aquatic vegetation (emergent and submerged); (6) pools (vertically submerged cavity, closed cavity, and recirculating reservoir); (7) meander bends; and (8) confluence of streams. The long-term goal is to use the classification scheme presented to develop predictive mean residence times for different STS using field-measurable hydromorphic parameters and obtain an effective STS mean residence time. The effective STS mean residence time can then be deconvolved from the transient storage residence time distribution (measured from a tracer test) to obtain an estimate of HTS mean residence time. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2013.},

For sparse canopies, the flow resembles a rough boundary layer. For dense canopies, the flow resembles a mixing layer. At the reach scale, flow resistance is more closely connected to the patch-scale vegetation distribution, described by the blockage factor, than to the geometry of individual plants. The impact of vegetation distribution on sediment movement is discussed, with attention being paid to methods for estimating bed stress within regions of vegetation.

After volume, mean residence time is the most important metric of STS, but it is unclear how this can be measured accurately or related to other timescales and field-measureable parameters. We studied mean residence time of lateral STS in small streams over Reynolds numbers (Re) 5000-200,000 and STS width to length (W/L) aspect ratios between 0.2-0.75. Lateral STS have flow fields characterized by a shear layer spanning the length of the STS entrance, and one primary gyre and one or more secondary gyre(s) in the STS. The study's purpose was to define, measure, and compare residence timescales: volume to discharge ratio (Langmuir timescale); area under normalized concentration curve; and characteristic time of exponential decay, and to compare these timescales to field measureable parameters. The best estimate of STS mean residence time-primary gyre residence time-was determined to be the first characteristic time of exponential decay. An apparent mean residence time can arise, which is considerably larger than other timescales, if probes are placed within secondary gyre(s). The Langmuir timescale is the minimum mean residence time, and is linearly correlated to channel velocity and STS width. The lateral STS mean residence time can be predicted using a physically based hydromorphic timescale derived by Uijttewaal et al.

We present results from an inter-disciplinary study of two river reaches in the River Frome catchment, Dorset (UK). The investigation focused on how Ranunculus (water crowfoot), the dominant submerged macrophyte in the study reaches, modified patterns of flow and sediment deposition. Measurements were taken on a monthly basis throughout 2003 to determine seasonal patterns in macrophyte cover, associated changes in the distributions of flow velocities and the character and amount of accumulated fine sediment within stands of Ranunculus. Maximum in-stream cover of macrophytes exceeded 70{\%} at both sites. Flow velocities were less than 0.1 m s- 1 within the stands of Ranunculus and accelerated to 0.8 m s- 1 outside the stands. During the early stages of the growth of Ranunculus, fine sediment mostly accumulated within the upstream section of the plant but the area of fine sediment accumulation extended into the downstream trailing section of the plant later in the growing season. The fine sediment accumulations were dominated by sand (63-1000 $\mu$m) with silts and clays (0.37-63 $\mu$m) comprising {\textless} 10{\%} by volume. The content of organic matter in the accumulated sediments varied within stands, between reaches and through the growing season with values ranging between 9 and 105 mg g- 1 dry weight. At the reach scale the two sites exhibited different growth forms of Ranunculus which created distinctive patterns of flow and fine sediment deposition. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A main vortical structure dominates the in-cavity flow which, despite the shallow nature of the flow, features a remarked three dimensional dynamics. LES results outline the largest velocities through the mouth of the cavity are attained in two thin regions near the bottom-bed and free-surface. In the shear layers established between the main channel and cavities is where the main transfer of turbulent momentum is made between these two flow regions, and the numerical simulations capture well the instantaneous coherent flow structures, e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices. LES captures a low-frequency standing wave phenomenon even with a rigid-lid approximation adopted at the free-surface boundary. Momentum exchange between cavities and main channel is analysed using the Reynolds Averaged momentum equation in the transverse direction, revealing that the pressure gradient term is the unique contributor to flushing momentum out of the cavities whilst convection and Reynolds normal stress terms are responsible for its entraining into the cavity. Furthermore, sediment deposition areas documented in the laboratory experiments are linked with the simulated hydrodynamics, which correlate with regions of low turbulent kinetic energy and vertical velocities near the bottom of the channel. Overall, the results shed new light into the complex mechanisms involved in mass and momentum transfer; this will aid to design embayments more efficiently regarding sediment transport processes.},

We included species that differ in their dispersal, and hence their intrinsic potential for gene flow. Over large distances, subdivision was generally greater among estuarine populations than among conspecific marine populations collected over similar distances. Over small distances, paired marine and estuarine samples were generally more divergent than pairs of marine samples separated by similar distances. For species with a low capability for dispersal, estuaries appear to add to the high levels of genetic subdivision that commonly result from other factors. Under special circumstances estuaries may also provide opportunities for genetic divergence in species with a high capability of dispersal that are rarely subdivided at a large geographical scale. These observations indicate that estuaries can increase the genetic subdivision of populations of inshore fishes, and that species that use both marine and estuarine habitats are likely to have greater genetic subdivision than those that are restricted to marine habitats.},

Removal of vegetation and CWD decreased transient storage area (As) by 61{\%} and 43{\%} in the agricultural and blackwater streams, respectively, and decreased the portion of median travel time owing to transient storage (Fmed) by 45{\%} and 56{\%}, respectively. Flow baffles were then added to create in-channel transient storage in both streams. Baffles increased As 227{\%} and 119{\%} for the agricultural and blackwater streams, respectively, and increased Fmed 309{\%} and 132{\%}, respectively. Ammonium and PO4 uptake for the blackwater stream, determined by using nutrient addition experiments and expressed as the mass transfer coefficient (Vf), decreased after CWD removal by 88{\%} and 38{\%}, respectively. Ammonium Vf in the blackwater stream increased 143-fold after baffles were installed, and PO4 Vf increased from -1.7 to 53 mm min-1. Nutrient uptake rates were not calculated for the agricultural stream because sediment disturbance inadvertently altered the sediment-water column nutrient equilibrium. Results from both streams demonstrate that in-channel transient storage, rather than hyporheic storage, can be a substantial portion of overall transient storage in streams. In-channel transient storage influenced nutrient uptake in a blackwater stream, although these results could not be corroborated with data from the agricultural stream. {\textcopyright} 2005, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.}

Currently, the predictive mean residence time relies on an empirical entrainment coefficient with a range in variance due to the absence of hydraulic and geomorphic quantities driving mass exchange. Two empirically derived relationships are presented for the mean residence time of lateral cavities - a prevalent and widely recognized type of transient storage - in gravel-bed rivers and streams that incorporates hydraulic and geomorphic parameters. The relationships are applicable for gravel-bed rivers and streams with a range of cavity width to length (W/L) aspect ratios (0.2-0.75), shape, and Reynolds numbers (Re, ranging from 1.0 × 10 4  to 1.0 × 10 7 ). The relationships equate normalized mean residence time to nondimensional quantities: Froude number, Re, W/L, depth ratio (ratio of cavity to shear layer depth), roughness factor (ratio of shear to channel velocity), and shape factor (representing degree of cavity equidimensionality). One relationship excludes bed roughness (equation (13)) and the other includes bed roughness (equation (14)). The empirically derived relationships have been verified for  conservative tracers (R 2  of 0.83) within a range of flow and geometry conditions.

    abstract     = {The effect of periphyton biomass on hydraulic characteristics and nutrient cycling was studied in laboratory streams with and without snail herbivores. Hydraulic characteristics, such as average water velocity, dispersion coefficients, and relative volume of transient storage zones (zones of stationary water), were quantified by performing short-term injections of a conservative tracer and fitting an advection-dispersion model to the conservative tracer concentration profile downstream from the injection site. Nutrient cycling was quantified by measuring two indices: (1) uptake rate of phosphorus from stream water normalized to gross primary production (GPP), a surrogate measure of total P demand, and (2) turnover rate of phosphorus in the periphyton matrix. These measures indicate the importance of internal cycling (within the periphyton matrix) in meeting the P demands of periphyton. Dense growths of filamentous diatoms and blue-green algae accumulated in the streams with no snails (high-biomass streams), whereas the periphyton communities in streams with snails consisted almost entirely of a thin layer of basal cells of Stigeoclonium sp. (low-biomass streams). Dispersion coefficients were significantly greater and transient storage zones were significantly larger in the high-biomass streams compared to the low-biomass streams. Rates of GPP-normalized P uptake from water and rates of P turnover in periphyton were significantly lower in high biomass than in low biomass periphyton communities, suggesting that a greater fraction of the P demand was met by recycling in the high biomass communities. Increases in streamwater P concentration significantly increased GPP-normalized P uptake in high biomass communities, suggesting diffusion limitation of nutrient transfer from stream water to algal cells in these communities. Our results demonstrate that accumulations of periphyton biomass can alter the hydraulic characteristics of streams, particularly by increasing transient storage zones, and can increase internal nutrient cycling. They suggest a close coupling of hydraulic characteristics and nutrient cycling processes in stream ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 1994 Springer Verlag.},

We analyze a 34-year dataset on a shallow embayment of the tidal freshwater Potomac River, Gunston Cove, for long-term responses of ambient nutrient levels, light transparency measures, phytoplankton biomass, and coverage of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) to decreased nutrient loading. Point source loading of phosphorus, the nutrient most limiting primary production in this system, was greatly curtailed coincident with the study onset (1983/84) exhibiting a sharp decrease of 95{\%} from peak loading levels. However, water column total phosphorus decreased much more slowly and gradually. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a did not show a distinctive decrease until 2000 and SAV responded strongly beginning in 2004. The habitat suitability model for SAV developed by Chesapeake Bay researchers was able to explain the recovery of SAV coverage based on data on light transparency and basin morphometry collected in this study. The study results were consistent with the alternative stable state theory with a sharp transition from a phytoplankton-dominated “turbid water” state to an SAV-dominated “clear water” state in a 2-year period from 2003 to 2005. The system eventually responded to nutrient load reductions, but the nonlinear and incomplete nature of this recovery and the two-decade delay illustrate the complexities of managing these systems.},

    abstract     = {Multiple physico-chemical and biological indicators were used to delineate the spatial influence of the Motueka River plume on coastal surface sediments and associated biota in Tasman Bay, New Zealand. Sediments were primarily muds at nearshore sites on all transects and comprised coarser sediments at the most seaward sites in Tasman Bay. Organic carbon/nitrogen ratios, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, and certain lipid biomarkers and trace metals provided suitable indicators of terrestrial and riverine influence on subtidal sediments. Analysis of these parameters revealed a discernible catchment influence extending at least 6 km offshore in the river outwelling plume, with a pronounced signature evident at two sampling stations within approximately 2km of the Motueka River mouth. At these two nearshore sites, nickel and chromium from natural upper-catchment sources were present at concentrations greatly exceeding sediment quality thresholds for probable ecological effects. The infaunal assemblage at these sites comprised low densities of a few opportunistic taxa, with the spatial distribution of organisms strongly correlated with trace metal concentrations. Although a causal relationship with trace metals is possible, other unmeasured influences such as gradients of salinity, depth and physical disturbance could conceivably be the primary drivers of the biological pattern. By contrast with the effects on infauna, analyses of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and trace metals in epibenthic shellfish did not reveal any evidence of a direct terrestrial or riverine influence. Overall, the results from this work indicate a relatively localised river plume effect on subtidal sediments and the associated infaunal assemblage. However, because previous work has shown that the river plume can extend tens of kilometres offshore during flood flows, further investigation is required to understand changes in seabed parameters within the context of spatio-temporal variation in catchment inputs and river plume discharge. {\textcopyright} 2007, Copyright Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

To better understand the impact of recent large increases of SAV on the fish community in tidal freshwater reaches of the Potomac River, we compared traditional seine sampling from shore with drop ring sampling of SAV beds (primarily Hydrilla) in a shallow water (depths, {\textless}1.5 m) embayment, Gunston Cove. To accomplish this, we developed species-specific catch efficiency values for the seine gear and calculated area-based density in both shoreline and SAV habitats in late summer of three different years (2007, 2008, and 2009). For the dominant species (Fundulus diaphanus, Lepomis macrochirus, Etheos-toma olmstedi, Morone americana, Lepomis gibbosus, and Fundulus heteroclitus), density was nearly always higher in SAV, but overall, species richness was highest in shoreline habitats sampled with seines. Although historical monitoring of fish in Gunston Cove (and throughout Chesapeake Bay) is based upon seine sampling (and trawl sampling in deeper areas), the high densities of fish and larger areal extent of SAV indicated that complementary sampling of SAV habitats would produce more accurate trends in abundances of common species. Because drop ring samples cover much less area than seines and may miss rare species, a combination of methods that includes seine sampling is needed for biodiversity assessment. The resurgence of SAV in tidal freshwater signifies improving water quality, and methods we evaluated here support improved inferences about population trends and fish community structure as indicators of ecosystem condition. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

We characterize in-channel transient storage with a rhodamine WT solute tracer experiment in a 304 m cascade-pool-type bedrock reach with no hyporheic zone. We compare the solute breakthrough curve (BTC) from this reach to that of an adjacent 367 m alluvial reach with significant hyporheic exchange. In the bedrock reach, transient storage has an exponential residence time distribution with a mean residence time of 3.0 hours and a ratio of transient storage to stream volume of 0.14, demonstrating that at moderate discharge, bedrock in-channel storage zones provide a small volume of transient storage with substantial residence time. In the alluvial reach, though pools are similar in size to those in the bedrock reach, transient storage has a power law residence time distribution with a mean residence time of {\textgreater}100 hours (estimated at nearly 1200 hours) and a ratio of storage to stream volume of 105. Because the in-channel hydraulics of bedrock reaches are simpler than alluvial step-pool reaches, the bedrock results are probably a lower end-member with respect to volume and residence time, though they demonstrate that in-channel storage may be appreciable in some reaches. These results suggest that in-stream dead zone transient storage may be accurately simulated by exponential RTDs but that hyporheic exchange is better simulated with a power law RTD as a consequence of more complicated flow path and exchange dynamics.

In this study monthly measurements of Secchi depth from 1986 to 1989 were related to concentrations of nutrients, phytoplankton biomass (as chl a) and resuspended particles (mineral and organic) to evaluate their influence on water turbidity within 10 different basins of the Limfjord. The overall median concentrations of total N (0.87 mg l-1 and total P (0.072 mg l-1) were high, anti total N accounted tot 55.6{\%} of the spatial variability in the chl a concentrations. Secchi depth transparency was highly variable as a result of seasonal fluctuations rather than spatial differences. Within all 10 basins the seasonal changes in Secchi depth were closely related to suspended particle concentrations (R2 = 0408 to 0.667). Suspended inorganic matter could account for more of the variability in attenuation than chl a in half of the basins, and was closely related to wind-induced sediment suspension. Episodes of high water turbidity associated with high wind activity are, therefore, likely to influence the areal distribution of eelgrass within the Limfjord. Reduction in nutrient loading is expected to increase water clarity as suggested by the direct relationship of chl a to total N. The impact is limited, however, by high levels of suspended mineral particles, such that Secchi depth transparency, closely related to eelgrass depth penetration, is only likely to increase by 10.6 to 17.5{\%} following a 2- fold reduction in phytoplankton biomass. Continued resuspension following the long-term perturbation of the entire embayment is, therefore, likely to constrain eelgrass colonization following nutrient abatement.},

It could be shown that the fresh sediments are less polluted than the deeper older ones. During the extreme flood of the river Elbe in August 2002 the critical erosion shear stress in the groyne fields was high enough to remobilise a considerable portion of the sediment depot. The hazard to the environment is high due to the fact that a significant part of the remobilised polluted sediments was distributed over the recent floodplain which is normally used as pasture. Thus these groyne field sediments represent a temporary danger for the water quality of the river Elbe. But the hazard of the solids sedimented in the recent floodplain of the river can be viewed as long-lasting. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

In 1995, two different physical barriers that permitted boat passage were constructed. One had tandem V-shaped weirs placed at the entrance of a cove, and the other had two gated barriers that confined an embayment connecting two arms of the reservoir. Grass carp were radio-tagged, stocked into the confined areas (N = 119 for the V-shaped barrier and N = 69 for the gated barrier), and tracked from December 1995 through September 1997 to estimate escape rates. In addition, 18,000 triploid grass carp fitted with coded wire tags were stocked in December 1995 into the two confined areas. A low-voltage (3-4 V) electric barrier (Smith-Root, Inc.) was installed in December 1997 at one of the V-shaped funnel barriers, and an additional 84 grass carp were radio-tagged and tracked for 13 months. Based on verified locations outside the confined areas, an average of 9{\%} of the grass carp escaped through the V-shaped, and 23{\%} escaped through the gated barriers each year. However, based on missing fish, tag functioning rates determined from dead fish or expelled tags, and locations of fish before becoming missing, potentially up to 42{\%} of the grass carp escaped from the V-shaped barriers and 35{\%} escaped from the gated barriers each year. In addition, electrofishing surveys conducted in summer 1998 downstream of the tailrace in the Apalachicola River, Florida, indicated that 68{\%} of the grass carp were escaped fish (coded wire tag present) that were stocked nearly 3 years earlier into the confined areas. After the V-shaped barrier was fitted with an electric barrier, no verified escapes occurred and with the exception of one fish, every radio-tagged grass carp was found within the confined area. Therefore, the maximum escape rate was only 1.3{\%} per year, if this fish did indeed escape. Thus, the electric barrier and confinement structure have the potential to provide managers with a tool to confine grass carp in specific areas of large water bodies. Over many years, control of excessive aquatic macrophytes with this system is about 10{\%} of the cost of herbicide treatments or mechanical harvesting.}

In lowland rivers, the high abundance of submerged vegetation can increase water transient storage, bioreactive surface areas, and, ultimately, in-stream metabolic activity. Changes in flow resulting from climatic and anthropogenic factors that influence the presence of aquatic vegetation can also, thereby, impact in-stream metabolism and nutrient cycling. We investigated the effects of water column depth on aquatic vegetation cover and its implications on water transient storage and associated metabolic activity in stream mesocosms (n = 8) that represent typical conditions of lowland streams. Continuous injections of metabolically reactive (resazurin-resorufin) tracers were conducted and used to quantify hydraulic transport and whole-mesocosm aerobic respiration. Acetate, a labile carbon source, was added during a second stage of the tracer injection to investigate metabolic responses. We observed both higher vegetation coverage and resazurin uptake velocity, used as a proxy of mesocosm respiration, with increasing water column depth. The acetate injection had a slight, positive effect on metabolic activity. A hydrodynamic model estimated the water transport and retention characteristics and first-order reactivity for three mesocosms. These results suggest that both the vegetated surface water and sediments contribute to metabolically active transient storage within the mesocosms, with vegetation having a greater influence on ecosystem respiration. Our findings suggest that climate and external factors that affect flow and submerged vegetation of lowland rivers will result in changes in stream respiration dynamics and that submerged vegetation is a particularly important and sensitive location for stream respiration.},

The direct link between the mechanism of mass exchange and the dynamics of coherent structures is demonstrated. It is shown that for the geometrical configuration considered in the present study, the mass exchange process is very non-uniform over the depth in the vicinity of the channel-embayment interface. Most of the contaminant is ejected from the embayments close to the free surface. The amount of contaminant re-entrained into the embayments situated downstream of the one in which contaminant was introduced is quantified. The mass exchange coefficient predicted by LES does not vary significantly with the embayment rank and is in very good agreement with the one predicted by the model proposed by Weitbrecht et al. (J Hydraul Eng 134(2):173-183, 2008) based on the value of a dimensionless morphometric groyne-field parameter. Field experiments were purposely performed in a natural stream with embayments whose length over width ratios were close to the ratio in the LES study. The concentration fields predicted by LES are compared with video-records of colored dye used to visualize the mass exchange in the field experiment. It is shown that, for both LES and the field experiment, the dominant passage frequency of the eddies inside the interfacial mixing layer is well predicted by the analytical model of Sukhodolov and Sukhodolova (in: Cowen et al (eds) Hydraulic measurements {\&} experimental methods. Proceedings of international conference, Lake Placid, USA, pp 172-177, 2007). The model is then used to scale the time in the LES animations and field video-records showing the temporal evolution of the concentration field. The results of the comparison indicate several similarities in the mixing process, despite the differences in the bathymetry and the large difference in the Reynolds number between LES and the field experiment. This proves the usefulness of performing detailed LES and laboratory studies in well-controlled environments to understand mass-exchange processes around river groyne fields.},

    abstract     = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has consolidated as a tool to provide understanding and quantitative information regarding many complex environmental flows. The accuracy and reliability of CFD modelling results oftentimes come under scrutiny because of issues in the implementation of and input data for those simulations. Regarding the input data, if an approach based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is applied, the turbulent scalar fluxes are generally estimated by assuming the standard gradient diffusion hypothesis (SGDH), which requires the definition of the turbulent Schmidt number, S ct (the ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass diffusivity in the turbulent flow). However, no universally-accepted values of this parameter have been established or, more importantly, methodologies for its computation have been provided. This paper firstly presents a review of previous studies about S ct in environmental flows, involving both water and air systems. Secondly, three case studies are presented where the key role of a correct parameterization of the turbulent Schmidt number is pointed out. These include: (1) transverse mixing in a shallow water flow; (2) tracer transport in a contact tank; and (3) sediment transport in suspension. An overall picture on the use of the Schmidt number in CFD emerges from the paper.},

    abstract     = {This paper examines a variety of recirculation flow patterns that develop in the groyne fields on rivers. A comprehensive data set was obtained from flume experiments at Delft University of Technology and field measurements performed on the Elbe River in Germany. The analysis focuses on patterns of velocity, scour and deposition, and corresponding change of riverbed morphology. The results show that velocity patterns in the groyne fields depend mainly on the aspect ratio between groyne length and length of groyne field. When the aspect ratio is greater than 0�5, a one-gyre pattern of recirculation develops, while at groyne fields with aspect ratios less than 0�5 a two-gyre recirculation pattern emerges. The spatial distribution of fine-sediment deposition between the groynes coincides with the locations of gyres. Moreover, the thickness of the fine-sediment layer decreases toward the gyre margins where recirculation velocities are greatest. Although the total concentration of suspended sediment in the river does not change considerably as the flow moves through the groyne field, the biological and gravimetrical composition of the suspended material changes substantially within the groyne field. These changes are due to preferential deposition of coarse mineral particles and the replacement of those minerals with finer organic material. Copyright � 2002 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

    abstract     = {Experiments have been carried out in a fixed-bed flume for a schematized straight river reach with groynes on one side to study the dynamics of the flow near groynes. The flume had a geometrical scale of 1∶40 1 40 , based on typical dimensions of the Dutch River Waal. Both emergent and submerged groynes were studied. The measurements demonstrate the differences in the nature of the turbulence between submerged and emerged groynes stages; and provide insight into the flow pattern in the vicinity of groynes, the shape and the extent of the mixing layer at different flow stages, and the dynamic behavior of the velocity along the mixing layer between the main channel and the groyne fields. A parameterization of the turbulence characteristics of the flow near groynes is presented. Large-scale velocity fluctuations are found in all test cases, with timescales that vary with the flow stage. The large-scale u u and v v velocity fluctuations are in phase in the center of the mixing layer and out of phase for the points on the boundaries of the mixing layer.
