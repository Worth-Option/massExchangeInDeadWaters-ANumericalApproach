abstract = {Abstract Groynes are widespread in the Middle Elbe River. They are important for navigation during low water. Due to the significant decrease of the flow velocity in comparison to the main stream, sedimentation of fine organic matter in the groyne fields (the area between two groynes) is high. The amount and location of sedimentation depend on hydraulic processes. The present paper presents the results of the actual (recent) sedimentation, and of the matter deposited in a typical groyne field in the Middle Elbe at Havelberg (German navigation km 420.9/river length 785.4). Furthermore, the development of water quality and suspended matter is described by the interpretation of data from an adjacent official water quality measuring point. From an ecological point of view, the high loads of nutrients and pollutants of the fine-grained sediment (mud) are of special interest. A close correlation was observed between the nutrient and pollutant load with the fine-grain size percentage and the content of particulate organic matter (POM). Groyne fields act as temporary sediment deposits, and are a latent danger to the ecosystem river Elbe. During construction work carried out at the river and extreme floods the mud could be remobilized, leading to a decrease in the water quality of the Elbe. Therefore, it is desirable that the organic mud should be removed from the river and deposited in a controlled landfill.},

abstract = {Dead-water zones (DWZs) in natural open channels, formed by embayment or consecutive groins, can provide favorable growth conditions for aquatic organisms. Although flow hydrodynamics in side-cavity zones have been well studied, the impact of vegetation on recirculating flow is rarely considered. This study adopts large eddy simulation (LES) to examine the flow field in a rectangular embayment zone with different population densities of vegetation. The numerical model is validated by mean streamwise velocity data collected near mid-depth in the physical experiment. Vegetation rearranges the circulation structure in the DWZ and weakens the velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. This negative effect increases with increasing population density. With the development of the shedding vortex induced in the front edge of the channel–embayment interface, the large-scale coherent structure forms in the mixing layer and is hardly affected by the variation of population density. As the population density increases, the mean retention time first decreases and then increases as a result of the combined action of three factors, namely, the large-scale coherent structure, the plant-induced Karman vortex street, and the blocking effect of dense vegetation.},

For the wall boundary a local equilibrium is assumed, yielding among others a logarithmic behavior for the mean flow velocity. The constants of the K‐ε model are related to the roughness conditions.

The obstacles are modelled as rectangular blocks and are located at one channel wall, perpendicular to the main stream direction. Two aspect ratios of the resulting dead zones are analysed. The flow structure is experimentally characterised by particle image velocimetry measurements in a laboratory flume and simulated using three-dimensional Large Eddy Simulations. Good agreement between experimental measurements and numerical results is obtained. The results show that the effect of the obstacles in the main channel is observed up to one obstacle length in the spanwise direction. The spacing between obstacles does not seem to have a large influence in the outer flow. The mean flow within the dead zone is characterised by a large recirculation region and several additional vortex systems.

abstract = {Many wetlands around the world are characterized by shallow water, dense vegetation in the littoral zones, no significant riverine inflow and minimal circulation. Recent research on the hydrodynamics of such wetlands has identified convective circulation as being important for flushing of the littoral zones. To quantify this process, a parameterization of the convective discharge per unit width, which had been previously developed for nonvegetated systems, was extended to include a drag coefficient dependent on Reynolds number and vegetation density. The drag coefficient also included the effect of anisotropic permeability of the vegetation. The effects of relatively dense emergent vegetation (~17\% by volume) on convective flushing of shallow wetlands with low-Reynolds number (~100) flow was then investigated using experiments in a laboratory convection tank (0.5 by 2 by 0.1 m) and in a wetland mesocosm (5 by 15 by 1 m). Bottom convective currents of ~1-10 mm s21 were measured in both the laboratory and the mesocosm. These currents resulted in the shallow, vegetated regions of the mesocosm being flushed in 4 h. The discharge per unit width (m2 s-1) predicted by the developed parameterization compared favorably (R2 = 0.7) with the discharge per unit width measured in both the laboratory and the mesocosm. The short timescales of convective flushing, even in the presence of reasonably dense vegetation, indicate the likely significance of this mechanism in sheltered wetlands.},

abstract = { This research is aimed at finding efficient alternative designs, in the physical, economical, and ecological sense, for the standard groynes as they are found in the large rivers of Europe. In order to test the effects of various groyne shapes on the flow in a groyne field, experiments were performed in a physical model of a schematized river reach, geometrically scaled 1:40. Four different types of schematized groynes were tested, all arranged in an array of five identical groyne fields, i.e., standard reference groynes, groynes with a head having a gentle slope and extending into the main channel, permeable groynes consisting of pile rows, and hybrid groynes consisting of a lowered impermeable groyne with a pile row on top. Flow velocities were measured using particle tracking velocimetry. The design of the experiment was such that the cross-sectional area blocked by the groyne was the same in all cases. Depending on the groyne head shape and the extent of submergence variations in the intensity of vortex shedding and recirculation in the groyne field were observed. The experimental data are used to understand the physical processes like vortex formation and detachment near the groyne head. It is demonstrated that the turbulence properties near and downstream of the groyne can be manipulated by changing the permeability and slope of the groyne head. It is also observed that for submerged conditions the flow becomes complex and locally dominated by three-dimensional effects, which will make it difficult to predict by applying depth average numerical models or by three-dimensional models with a coarse resolution in the vertical direction.}

abstract = { This study explores the three-dimensional structure of turbulent flow around a sequence of groynes in a river reach under semi-controlled conditions. Detailed measurements were carried out in groyne fields with aspect ratios (length of groynes/distance between successive groynes) of 0.75 and 0.35 for emerged and submerged conditions and provided detailed spatial patterns of mean and turbulent fluxes of momentum. The results indicate that in mixing interfaces the vertical fluxes of turbulent momentum are dominant near the riverbed whereas horizontal fluxes dominate near the surface. Strong three-dimensional effects are reported for submerged groynes when a wake is formed at the leeward side. Groyne sequences increase flow resistance mainly by flow constriction that in turn generates an increase in velocity and bed shear stress in the main channel, rather than by production of excessive turbulence near the groynes. }

abstract = {Surface transient storage (STS) has functional significance in stream ecosystems because it increases solute interaction with sediments. After volume, mean residence time is the most important metric of STS, but it is unclear how this can be measured accurately or related to other timescales and field-measureable parameters. We studied mean residence time of lateral STS in small streams over Reynolds numbers (Re) 5000–200,000 and STS width to length (W/L) aspect ratios between 0.2–0.75. Lateral STS have flow fields characterized by a shear layer spanning the length of the STS entrance, and one primary gyre and one or more secondary gyre(s) in the STS. The study's purpose was to define, measure, and compare residence timescales: volume to discharge ratio (Langmuir timescale); area under normalized concentration curve; and characteristic time of exponential decay, and to compare these timescales to field measureable parameters. The best estimate of STS mean residence time—primary gyre residence time—was determined to be the first characteristic time of exponential decay. An apparent mean residence time can arise, which is considerably larger than other timescales, if probes are placed within secondary gyre(s). The Langmuir timescale is the minimum mean residence time, and is linearly correlated to channel velocity and STS width. The lateral STS mean residence time can be predicted using a physically based hydromorphic timescale derived by Uijttewaal et al. (2001) with an entrainment coefficient of 0.031 ± 0.009 for the Re and W/L studied.},

In particular, the influence of dead-water zones, as they are given by groin fields, on the transport characteristics in the main stream has been analyzed. A literature review of detailed map material from the rivers Rhine, Waal and Elbe has been performed, in order to plan representative laboratory experiments. Typical aspect ratios of the groin fields as well as typical inclination angles have been summarized. Based on these results, experiments have been performed in a laboratory flume equipped with schematized groins. Within theses experiments the aspect ratio, the inclination angles as well as the groin field volume has been varied. Due to the fact that the flow is very shallow and, therefore, quasi two-dimensional, the flow velocities have been determined at the water surface, using a Surface Particle-Image-Velocimetry-System that has been developed for that purpose. Additional measurements, using a two-dimensional Laser-Doppler-Velocimeter, have been performed for resolving the velocity distribution over the water depth. With the help of these measurements it was possible to determine the typical recirculating flows in the groin fields as well as the coherent, horizontal eddies in the mixing layer between dead-water zone and main stream, that are governing the mass exchange. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the surface PIV measurements made it possible to estimate also the mass exchange between groin field and main stream. With the help of Planar-Concentration-Analysis, which is a method for determining depth-averaged planar concentration fields, it could be shown that the mass exchange between groin field and main stream increases with increasing length of the groin field. For these measurements a tracer injection device has been developed, that consists of a movable multi-port injection-box and vacuum-pressure-unit, which is able to produce instantaneously, homogeneous and reproducible concentration fields. Finally a Lagrangian-Particle-Tracking-Method was developed to transfer the results, obtained locally at single groin fields, into the overall transport characteristics in the far-field of pollutant spill scenario for a river system consisting of a series of groin fields. Through the implementation of a transient-adhesion-boundary, it was possible to parameterize the influence of groin fields on the longitudinal dispersion, the transport velocity and the skewness of the concentration distribution in the case of a pollutant spill.},

This paper reports the results of field experiments in a natural river comprising large-scale groyne models populated with rigid and flexible artificial vegetation. In the experimental runs population density, submergence ratios, and vegetation types were varied. The results show that vegetation rearranges twin-circulation flow into slow backwater flow. The magnitude of backwater flow is controlled by the bio-mechanical properties of vegetation. The hydrodynamics of the flow interface between the main river and groyne fields was only slightly altered by vegetation. Analytical models of flow at the interface and inside vegetated areas agree well with these experimental results.},

abstract = {Peak power production in hydroelectric storage power plants results in frequent and intense flow variations in the rivers downstream of the plants. Fish populations can be negatively impacted when subjected to these so-called hydropeaking phenomena. In researching mitigation solutions, shelters in the riverbanks of channelized rivers have been identified as a means of protecting fish from excessive flow velocities. These shelters were studied systematically using juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) in an experimental configuration in which a straight channel was equipped with a lateral embayment. The purpose of the experiments was to generate hydrodynamic hydropeaking conditions in the channel that are undesirable for juvenile trout, thereby causing them to enter the shelter. The flow velocity distribution in the intersection plane between the main channel and the lateral shelter was found to be a significant parameter for attracting fish to the shelter. The utilization rate of trout in the shelter was used as a performance indicator. Using a basic rectangular shelter configuration without forced water exchange between the shelter and the channel, the utilization rate was only 35 {\%}. This rate was more than doubled by introducing a deviation groyne to force water exchange between the channel and the shelter. The position and orientation angle of this groyne were systematically varied to maximize the utilization rate. Maximum utilization rates approaching 90 {\%} were obtained for an optimum configuration in which an island-type groyne was placed in the shelter. The results of the systematic channel tests showed the potential of the shelter to attract fish. Such a shelter could be used in channelized rivers both for morphological revitalization and to improve fish habitats. As a next step in this research, prototype shelters will be built on a natural river and monitored for 2–3 years under a hydropeaking flow regime.},

abstract = {The actively flowing waters of streams and rivers remain in close contact with surrounding off-channel and subsurface environments. These hydrologic linkages between relatively fast flowing channel waters, with more slowly flowing waters off-channel and in the subsurface, are collectively referred to as hydrologic exchange flows (HEFs). HEFs include surface exchange with a channel's marginal areas and subsurface flow through the streambed (hyporheic flow), as well as storm-driven bank storage and overbank flows onto floodplains. HEFs are important, not only for storing water and attenuating flood peaks, but also for their role in influencing water conservation, water quality improvement, and related outcomes for ecological values and services of aquatic ecosystems. Biogeochemical opportunities for chemical transformations are increased by HEFs as a result of the prolonged contact between flowing waters and geochemically and microbially active surfaces of sediments and vegetation. Chemical processing is intensified and water quality is often improved by removal of excess nutrients, metals, and organic contaminants from flowing waters. HEFs also are important regulators of organic matter decomposition, nutrient recycling, and stream metabolism that helps establish a balanced and resilient aquatic food web. The shallow and protected storage zones associated with HEFs support nursery and feeding areas for aquatic organisms that sustain aquatic biological diversity. Understanding of these varied roles for HEFs has been driven by the related disciplines of stream ecology, fluvial geomorphology, surface-water hydraulics, and groundwater hydrology. A current research emphasis is on the role that HEFs play in altered flow regimes, including restoration to achieve diverse goals, such as expanding aquatic habitats and managing dissolved and suspended river loads to reduce over-fertilization of coastal waters and offset wetland loss. New integrative concepts and models are emerging (eg, hydrologic connectivity) that emphasize HEF functions in river corridors over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {Abstract River restoration works often include measures to promote morphological diversity and enhance habitat suitability. One of these measures is the creation of macro-roughness elements, such as lateral cavities and embayments, in the banks of channelized rivers. However, in flows that are heavily charged with fine sediments in suspension, such as glacier-fed streams and very low-gradient reaches of large catchment rivers, these lateral cavities may trap these sediments. Consequently, the morphological changes may be affected, and the functionality of the restoration interventions may be compromised. Herein, we analyse the influence of these macro-roughness elements on the transport of fine sediments in the main channel. Laboratory tests with uniform flow charged with sediments in a channel with banks equipped with large-scale rectangular roughness elements were carried out. The laboratory experiments covered a wide range of rectangular cavity geometrical configurations and shallowness ratios. The influence of key parameters such as flow shallowness, geometric ratios of the cavities and initial sediment concentration was tested. Surface particle image velocimetry, sediment samples and temporal turbidity records were collected during the experiments. The amount of sediments captured by the cavities, the temporal evolution of the concentration of sediments in suspension and the flow hydrodynamics are cross-analysed and discussed. It is shown that the trapping efficiency of the macro-roughness elements is a clear function of the channel geometry and the shallowness of the flow.

abstract = {Natural lateral cavities in open channels are important because their lower water velocities promote water quality and provide refugia for organisms. Little is known about the influence of natural cavity shapes and roughness on flow structure and exchange dynamics. We investigated the effects of cavity shape (semi-circular, backward conic, and forward conic) and bed roughness on the flow structure and mean residence time (MRT) of a lateral cavity in a flume. All cavity shapes have a flow field dominated by a one-gyre recirculation pattern, contrasting results of rectangular cavities at similar Reynolds number and aspect ratios. Transverse velocity energy spectra indicate the flow is dominated by large-scale quasi-2D coherent structures. Fundamental frequencies of mixing layer vortex shedding are fastest for forward conic cavities and slowest for backward conic cavities. Fluid enters cavities at shallower mixing layer depths, and fluid exits cavities at deeper mixing layer depths. MRTs are smaller for hydraulically smooth cases and forward conic cavities due to higher recirculation velocities. MRTs are larger for rough bed cases and backward conic cavities. Rough flow cases have a strong correlation to a predictive MRT relationship derived by Jackson et al. (Water Resour Res: 10.1002/wrcr.20272, 2013) (R2 = 0.77); however, this predictive model does not work well for smooth cavities. Two MRT relationships were derived for smooth lateral cavities and both have strong power-law correlations to normalized MRT. Understanding cavity shape and bed roughness effects will provide a guideline for designing lateral embayments in stream restoration projects.},

abstract = {This experimental study describes the mean and turbulent flow structure in the wake of a circular array of cylinders, which is a model for a patch of emergent vegetation. The patch diameter, D, and patch density, a (frontal area per volume), are varied. The flow structure is linked to a nondimensional flow blockage parameter, CDaD, which is the ratio of the patch diameter and a drag length scale (CDa)−1. CD is the cylinder drag coefficient. The velocity exiting the patch, Ue, is reduced relative to the upstream velocity, U∞, and Ue/U∞ decreases as flow blockage (CDaD) increases. A predictive model is developed for Ue/U∞. The wake behind the patch contains two peaks in turbulence intensity. The first peak occurs directly behind the patch and is related to turbulence production within the patch at the scale of individual cylinders. The second peak in turbulence intensity occurs at distance Lwdownstream from the patch and is related to the wake-scale vortices of the von Karman vortex street. The presence of the flowUe in the wake delays the formation of the von Karman vortex street until distance L1 ({\textless}Lw) behind the patch. Both L1 and Lw increase as Ue increases and thus as the flow blockage (CDaD) decreases. L1sets the distance behind the patch within which fine-particle deposition can occur. BeyondLw, turbulence associated with the wake-scale vortices inhibits deposition.},

abstract = {In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the ecological role of groyne fields as habitats for aquatic vegetation; however, knowledge on interactions between vegetation and recirculating flow is still lacking, especially vegetation effects on large-scale coherent structures in the mixing layer, which control the mass exchange between the side-cavity and the main channel. In this paper, the hydrodynamics of the mixing layer in straight open channels without sediments in the flow, with consecutive groyne fields, of different vegetation densities, is investigated both experimentally through particle image velocimetry and numerically through large eddy simulation. The results show that the presence of plants rearranges the circulation systems in the groyne field, namely, from double gyres to a single gyre. With an increase in the vegetation density, the exchange coefficient between the cavity and the main channel gradually decreases. Note that the exchange rate is calculated from a newly proposed exchange layer, which is located away from the groyne tip. Based on the analysis of the Kelvin-Helmholtz eddies along the shear layer, a phenomenological model is proposed for the evolution of coherent structures and the variations in flow hydrodynamics associated with these eddies. Compared to the non-vegetation case, the presence of vegetation could suppress the evolution of coherent eddies in the mixing layer, with a consequent effect on the flow hydrodynamics around the interface.},

abstract = {The flow hydrodynamics in a straight open channel containing a multiple-embayment groyne field on one of its sides is investigated numerically using large eddy simulation. The vertical groynes are fully emerged. The mean flow depth in the groyne region is about half that of the main channel and the length and width of the embayments are much larger than the mean depth in the embayment region. The model is validated using mean velocity and turbulent fluctuations data collected at the free surface in a previous experimental study. It is found that despite the fact that the flow inside the main recirculation eddy in the embayments can be characterized as being quasi-two dimensional, the flow inside the mixing layer region between the embayments and the channel is strongly nonuniform over the depth. As this region controls the mass exchange processes between the groyne field and the main channel, a three-dimensional description of the flow in this area is essential. The large-scale eddies that populate the mixing layer can penetrate the embayment region over lateral distances of the order of the channel depth. These eddies advect with them channel fluid inside the. embayment. Eventually, the channel fluid is mixed with the embayment fluid by the small scales. The other main mixing mechanism is due to the injection of patches of high-vorticity mixing-layer fluid near the tip of the downstream groyne and their subsequent convection in the form of a wall-attached jet-like flow into the embayment, first parallel to the downstream groyne face and then to the sidewall. It is shown that on average, most of the fluid leaves the embayment region via the top layer of the embayment-channel interface (upstream half) and enters the embayment region at levels situated around the middepth (practically over the whole length of the embayment) of the interface surface. This explains why the mass exchange coefficients are overestimated when predicted using methods that employ floating particles as a tracer. The instantaneous bed shear stress inside the cavity is found to peak close to the downstream groyne face of each embayment and to show a high variability around the mean values due to the interaction of the mixing layer eddies with the tip of the groynes and the formation of the jet-like flow parallel to the droyne face.},

abstract = {The regulation of rivers and their valleys has had a strong, negative influence on the maintenance of their original biota. Nevertheless, some hydro-engineering works conducted along already regulated rivers may be beneficial, creating habitats for endangered species and assemblages. Such works include the construction of groynes. We analysed this effect on the occurrence of dragonfly larvae along middle and lower stretches of the Oder, where groynes were built over a distance of 306km, creating an area of uniform habitat. We demonstrated that the presence of groynes increased not only the abundance of dragonfly larvae, but also the species richness and diversity of these insects. Habitats were recreated for assemblages typical of a river with highly diverse habitat conditions, from typically riverine assemblages to those occurring in oxbow lakes, also endangered by regulations. The fauna along the stretches with groynes was richer and more valuable than that along the stretches without groynes, achieving values approaching those obtained from modelled unregulated rivers. This can be put down to greater habitat heterogeneity and groyne-reduced levels of waves produced by ships. The presence of groynes provides the key to the restoration or stabilisation of the populations of certain species and to renaturalisation processes.},

abstract = {The influence of groynes in large rivers on caddisflies has been poorly studied in the literature. Therefore, we carried out an investigation on the 420-km stretch of the River Oder equipped with groynes. At 29 stations, we caught caddisflies in four habitats: current sites, groyne fields, riverine control sites without groynes and in the river's oxbows. We found that groyne construction increased species richness, diversity, evenness, and altered the structure of functional groups into more diversified and sustainable ones compared to the control sites. The groyne field fauna is similar to that of natural lentic habitats, but its composition is largely governed by the presence of potential colonists in the nearby oxbows. We distinguished three of the river's caddisfly assemblages. The distribution of Trichoptera was governed inter alia by the plant cover and the amount of detritus, and consequently, the food resources. Oxygen, nitrates, phosphates and electrolytic conductivity were important as well. Groynes have had positive effects for caddisflies—not only those in the river itself, but also those in its valley. They can therefore be of significance in river restoration (although originally they served other purposes), especially with respect to the radically transformed ecosystems of large rivers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Lateral cavities are major storage zones in riverine environments for which the mass exchanges with the main stream strongly impact the characteristics of the habitat in these dead zones. An experimental work is presented here with a controlled main stream and a connected open-channel lateral cavity to assess the processes responsible for these exchanges and to quantify the exchange capacities. In a first step, the measurements of passive scalar transport allow us to identify the physical processes involved in the exchange of mass from the main stream and its spreading within the cavity. In a second step, the quantitative mass exchange coefficient, representative of the exchange capacity, is measured for 28 flow and cavity configurations. The sensibility analysis to the governing parameters proposed by the dimensional analysis then reveals that changing the geometric aspect ratio of the cavity does not affect the exchange coefficient while increasing the normalized water depth or decreasing the Reynolds number of the main stream tend to increase this coefficient. Indeed, these parameters modify both the growth rate of the mixing layer width at the interface and the amplitude of the alternating transverse velocity across the interface, thus affecting the exchange capacities from the main stream to the cavity.},

Available models are reviewed, with emphasis on their compatibility with modem CFD methods. Requirements for engineering transition models suitable for industrial CFD codes are specified. The main criterion is that nonlocal operations should be avoided. The U-Re?transition model was built on these requirements. The model solves two transport equations and can be applied to any arbitrary geometry. Current limitations of the model are that cross-flow instability is not included in the correlations and that the transition correlations are formulated non-Galilean invariant. Both limitations are currently investigated and can in principle be removed. An overview of test cases computed with the new model is given. The purpose of the overview is to highlight that the model can handle a wide variety of geometries and physically diverse problems. It is suggested that the central concept of combining transition correlations with locally formulated transport equations has a strong potential for including first-order transitional effects into today's industrial CFD simulations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Laboratory experiments are presented that model the exchange processes between a river and dead-water zones created by groin fields. The measurement methods include particle image velocimetry (PIV) at the water surface to capture the dynamics of the flow field as well as planar concentration analysis (PCA) to determine the depth integrated mass fluxes of dissolved tracer. Idealized groins with variable length-to-width ratios and inclination angles relative to the flow direction are investigated. Two-dimensional large coherent structures (2DLCS) are found in the mixing layer between the groin field and the river, and these flow structures control the majority of mixing with the main stream. The PIV data allow quantification of the turbulence intensity distribution in these structures throughout the groin field and mixing region. The PCA data provide measurements of the exchange rate between the groin field and the main stream. Both methods give comparable measures of the entrainment coefficient for the exchange flow. The entrainment coefficient is found to depend on the groin field hydraulic radius (a measure of the average size of 2DLCS in the mixing layer) and the water depth (a parameter controlling the stability of the shallow water flow). These data provide a link between the exchange parameter in groin field dead zones and the river properties that can be used to efficiently develop river alarm models to predict contaminant transport without requiring a large amount of field dye studies for calibration.

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics was used to study the evolution of small patches of vegetation into a vegetated landscape in a channel. The growth of new vegetation occurred in regions where the flow velocity was reduced below a threshold value defined as a fraction of the channel-average velocity (U0). Two threshold values, or limiting velocity values (LV), were used: LV = 0.5 and 0.7. Two initial blockage factors (percentage vegetation coverage of the channel) were considered, 3{\%} and 0.3{\%}, chosen to represent cases with and without, respectively, hydrodynamic interaction between the initial patches. The simulation illustrated both positive feedbacks between flow and vegetation, which enhanced vegetation expansion, and negative feedbacks, which led to patch erosion and limited patch growth. The most rapid expansion of the vegetated area occurred during the initial simulation steps, when the flow blockage due to vegetation was small. A higher velocity threshold (higher LV) produced more rapid initial growth and a higher final coverage of vegetation. The patches evolved to one or a few elongated islands extending along the channel.},

This mixing characterisation was combined with previously proposed computational fluid dynamics modelling approaches to predict residence time distributions for vegetated stormwater treatment pond layouts (including a wetland) derived from Highways England design guidance. The results showed that the presence of vegetation resulted in residence times closer to plug flow, indicating significant improvements in stormwater treatment capability. The new modelling approach reflects changes in residence time due to mixing within the vegetation, but it also suggests that it is more important to include vegetation within the model in the correct location than it is to accurately characterise it. Estimates of hydraulic efficiency suggest that fully vegetated stormwater ponds such as wetlands should function well as a treatment device, but more typical ponds with clear water need to be designed to be between 50{\%} and 100{\%} larger than their nominal residence times would suggest when designed against treatment criteria.},
