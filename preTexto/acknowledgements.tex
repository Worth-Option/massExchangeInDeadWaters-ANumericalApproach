\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank my family for all of their support. My parents have always
provided an example of how to cherish life, to finish difficult tasks, and pushed me to pursue excellence. I want to honor my brother, Jo√£o, for giving me friendship and an example of living life to the fullest.\\
I would like to thank Johannes Janzen for his direction, drive, and ambition. I would like to thank my laboratory colleagues for guiding this journey and for fellowship through out these years.\\
Thank you to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for providing the grace and mercy
to sustain and direct me through this endeavor.
