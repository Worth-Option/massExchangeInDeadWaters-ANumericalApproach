\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank my family for all of their support. My parents have always provided an example of how to cherish life, to finish difficult tasks, and pushed me to pursue excellence. I want to honour my brother, João, for giving me friendship and an example of living life to the fullest.

I would like to thank Johannes Janzen and Carlo Gualtieri for their direction, drive, and ambition.

I would like to thank Taís N. Yamasaki, Felipe Costa and Filipe Queiroz for boarding the projects and co-authoring many of the here published works.

Also, I would like to thank Taís for helping me to develop this career since my first steps at the laboratory. She has been a great work colleague and a wonderful friend through all these years.

I would like to thank my laboratory colleagues for guiding this journey and for fellowship through out these years. All those coffees were amazing and it was always rewarding and joyful to gather with you.

Thank you to my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for providing the grace and mercy to sustain and direct me through this endeavour.
